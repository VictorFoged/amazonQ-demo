# Post Feed Application

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how the future of software development could look like. It's a simple yet functional web application that allows users to create and view posts in a feed interface.

## Features

- Create and publish posts with a simple text input
- View posts in a chronological feed (newest first)
- Clean, responsive user interface
- Submit posts using the button or with Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut
- **Auto-reply feature**: Automatically generates a Danish out-of-office reply when certain keywords are detected in posts

## Auto-reply Feature: "Autosvar:andel - joke"

The application includes an auto-reply feature that simulates an out-of-office email response. When a user posts a message containing keywords like "mail", "email", "andel", etc., the system automatically generates a reply with a predefined Danish message.

The auto-reply message is:
```
Tak for din mail. Jeg er til til afdelingsdag torsdag d. 26. juni og læser derfor kun min mail sporadisk. Hvis din henvendelse haster, er du derfor meget velkommen til at kontakte mig på 29 38 41 13.

Rigtig god dag.

De bedste hilsner
Sofie Hvemon
```
